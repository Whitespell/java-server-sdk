     * The Action object is an object that gets executed by an event, endpoint, or incoming action packet from an application-authorized server or Whitespell server.
     * This model stores which dependencies an action depends on before being executed
     * Example: Dependencies is group_id. In the login script saves the variable group_id and this action fires off.
     * Actions should NEVER depend on any sort of user input. Input has to be validated by endpoints and not by actions.
     * Actions are stored in the {@link Application} model
     * Actions are stateless, and should be scalable. The {@link whitespell.logic.FrostwaveClient} notifies the action if the variables comes available
     * @param actionName            The name of the action, mainly used for logging purposes and reverse-lookup
     * @param actionType            The type of the action
     * @param variables                  The variables that lead to this action being executed
     * @returns Action
